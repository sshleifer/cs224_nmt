You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell into the place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it like a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I got to tap up every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the bathroom room.
I was doing it on a secret.
Three years old.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the years -- I felt the need to start working in organizations who fight AIDS AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to get stuck with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> and was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, had become a circle -- and that kind of epiphany that I told you about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked about today a lot of this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is connected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I wasn't able to think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> of snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break off the ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up until the end, whereas others can't get more and get them into a <unk> of passionate passion,
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, in large as we see ourselves as humans.
But it's actually the opposite.
As a <unk> you melts, I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg melts by an iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I approach them to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and will not be going to exist again.
It's not the death when you're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to witness an <unk> iceberg in it.
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starting <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is there.
This is an iceberg from the average size of the average.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> right.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about it, you know, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome -- and the sperm joins the X chromosome out of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is attached to the X chromosome out of the <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that is going to be two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- to say, human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working with, for example, with fraternal twins two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics would do not fit in male <unk> and female women.
And on <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that won't be <unk> in common or female forms.
For example, the case is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene in the chromosome -- and says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that become <unk>
And then, in the living life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the Yentl syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing, following a case typically <unk>
When I was <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the amount of time -- when someone realizes something is going on.
After you do tests and realize that instead of having ovaries and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a chromosome out.
The important thing to understand is you can think of a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands in the body.
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider to be a <unk> woman doesn't know its <unk> structure, and I believe being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and I had just figured out he had ovaries and <unk>
He had a extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had a 20th century -- and in the uterus the glands glands were so active that, essentially creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were exposed to the hormonal component of the hormone <unk>
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, a woman on the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is that they have tissue tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how well that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason they children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they are <unk> fraternal twins, or <unk> they are <unk> and it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are <unk> is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based usually in the idea that particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- being black that means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic.
And when we have a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children who are born as two people within one body.
The most high high school is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What a test are going to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that nature is so complicated that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who set that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these extraordinary categories we thought were a stable <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology that the terminology is.
As we see, we get into a really rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we become increasingly in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the <unk> of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body gets human, and it has different rights from the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As long as you put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it yet.
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this categories of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking about.
It was <unk> from the point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so courageous and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find each of you watching that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's why, in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of the city right to be born.
They had the concept of the blue <unk>
They were from the idea that the political power came to the right of the blood of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They gave them the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if we look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of international explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be passed through a <unk> idea of birth to birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were passing the idea of the <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundation of the future movement movement <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people like color people who are <unk> the <unk> of the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start to wonder why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some of them <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't mean by the age of five years to allow kids to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> that for me to make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Okay, so let's go back to those two things that are going to be at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So imagine that one of them, Mary. was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Now, whenever the other thing was born in term: was born on March March from 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before that Henry the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because after later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, for virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> by the liter of <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we do now that the science went through so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man that has no chromosome out to have chromosome -- and to marry a woman we have to have the <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests for people's tests.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to <unk>
So if you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I know <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very nice.
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we need to get involved in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of them <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of them -- that I know can make more intelligent intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the issue of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asked what would happen if the character of a person could in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe you can <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to lead this current stream of thinking relative to democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do good work in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed by <unk> unless they're willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows them to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had made to give birth twins to be able to give them a <unk> and then they <unk> his fame.
But when the phone asked her the reason of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, he responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the good state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical about a feminist, and it is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> -- they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my career I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> as <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there are no female <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think there is some female <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you were <unk> they were very aware to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they would have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make the democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union -- let's think about what we do about the others.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family is thinking where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we are far from that goal.
There are billions.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily be able to <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just run through apartment buildings.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that the other half is still not.
You might try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a whole new apartment building that is always and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction.
So I proposed that governments will bring up new educational zones of reform enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name -- cities under <unk>
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 <unk> they will come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular election of the next regular elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence for users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It was a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes as much of technologies as a norms for <unk> and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala I sent a link to the <unk>
I showed you <unk>
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable to how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City. which, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which would be <unk> and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those rules.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way our country is going to be.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that would measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles from distance to the North.
And we also add new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government <unk> would need help from countries <unk> they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everyone could trust the <unk> they will actually be <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily fill a few thousand square miles.
And little after that, the 19 of January voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that allowed these special development regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the <unk> all of the assets in society, the <unk>
By <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, spent again in another voting in <unk> to one.
After the voting of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new New York City, which is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical sense, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new criminal justice system.
There are urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that they wanted to move in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go in there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> were asked to say, "Thank you, TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, I would photograph and post on my blog suits and colorful and different <unk>
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothing is second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand <unk> allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I'm going to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my <unk>
I'll like the color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
So back to the issue of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anyone have that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
It was inside for exactly a week that's what I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got to <unk> <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>   That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger people.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always watch phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me up, and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> it's impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you would also be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who's in there.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remember them in their little age of seven years.
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't see you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: American <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people approached this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to home, I am going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave it back certain things.
I don't need to warn you, emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> colorful and brilliant colorful and brilliant colorful and bright colorful if there's a little bit of love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally <unk>
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
It can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physical physicists, we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We have to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the passage of the years is that one thing that says that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
I was a little boy and I didn't do it very well, it always gets <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar <unk> I taught him a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point the physics was a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to be able to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it wasn't good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all to follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why she shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it has been in an overlap in quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then we do a very good approach to the little metal <unk>
So what you see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and that stands for a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want to piss you out, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of the journey of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that pushes it, and the wind that goes on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to squeeze all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then they get a <unk> and pulled all the air down, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree at absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured its movements.
We discovered it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> And the way they were <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving a smooth <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and not at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all of the trillion atoms making that piece of metal are still still -- and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places. Why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part of speech.
So imagine if they were in many places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you make your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it down, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, and we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about the quantum mechanics -- he claims that everything is interconnected to.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head who is here and allowed me to bring it out.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
Lots of negotiations and stories, <unk> <unk> very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't love me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better I show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the gallery -- the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You're going to move around and get off.
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the top, and with one click, we jump into it.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
Just go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I had a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is about hitting a <unk> with a stick on a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep in depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to go through the image, so you'll see really what you are.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite night.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night, I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, you can create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple -- we walk in, and I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just climbed around it.
This is the <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel like looking at the <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, you know, I think, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to their artwork and that is represented online online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is you have to do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
So I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a flying pixel
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian -- all the kids in Italy grew up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is something really interesting happened in the year of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
There was some time ago, if you wanted to earn a career career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, it is <unk> system of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers back to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As one note you wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition for <unk> <unk> for the late <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms that would become sensors and <unk>
And that's actually changing the interaction that we have as humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end he took the hammer and I threw it into the Moses -- -- you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> What not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> -- <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and <unk>
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, I played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts with a silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Number two: End of time.
First time. second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, <unk>
That night, everyone went to <unk> the center.
You see the great peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we would not have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make a <unk> how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags that track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that we all have <unk>
And then we put them a little chip, a <unk> in the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped out is not just somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we dropped a day is still there yet.
If we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning, which is the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> which opens and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall in the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, you know?
And by <unk> the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
It liked it.
And we had a commission to design the building at the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or <unk> but when you go up there, it opens up so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof goes down the roof -- someone who was there and said, "You know, <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get almost all the architecture away.
This is working.
You see the people who are going on by what's going on inside.
And here I'm myself trying to stop it, when we test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept doing cutting and holes in water, and you had to jump out for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to prove that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have a little helicopter in the air and that each one of you had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like that we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, right?
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels to which you can close, and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with one input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of today, the star in New York City <unk> and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D time as a movement capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a oyster nursery -- like the <unk> of <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, of the <unk> of the networks to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something that would be built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move inside, to have different experiences.
You can see it from down, to be able to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are you?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have a resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and make sure themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to do with you the most <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you the view of a doctor on the subject.
The great 21st-century successes of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is also <unk> in the Church -- <unk> <unk> wrote a <unk> <unk> in biology makes sense to the light of the <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look into the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is, of course, the more we do.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 to 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the bacteria gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you about the <unk> you think of bacteria <unk>
The gut is an amazing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark, circulation is very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want without the effort of your part.
It's really like a fast way to bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the output.
But by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and a single <unk> of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you've got to.
When I just went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell is just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is led to the two daughters.
But when organisms appear <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death enters the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still fell in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a <unk> <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It's nice. He says George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily a different <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to have the genome of the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like invisible rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us let us go to the sea.
I think we all hate the feeling that <unk> <unk> when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily respond to longevity.
Not necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the most intelligent one.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> in a <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution -- and in particular, if we look forward to phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that they fit as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that you can produce a evolution of the traditional traditional type of natural type of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution can roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when <unk> planets are distant planets are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a <unk> intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose and the family and the family <unk>
Think also that if you could be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
They wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and she sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
In 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 dollars, and it was a week.
Not long enough to actually make the human genome for <unk> and being increasingly in the reach of all.
You come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental essay in the course of the flu vaccine with the flu vaccine cells in a plant plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
So imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the <unk> egg and give your children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes, will reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want the children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could get distracted by the next generation of <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100 thousand years and we can afford it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what you might think about, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a huge explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably get some <unk>
The pilot had already stepped out the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot ran on the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
We put the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three most <unk> words that have been heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
I was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to take and never <unk>
As I thought later on, I came up with one sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while I took the bridge George Washington, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I put in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I <unk> it, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be breaks in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I came back, I had the sense of, Wow, it's not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in one thought, which is, I just wish a thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live otherwise.
You are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please don't be so -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What do you want to do is they still expect to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How would their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I clearly have been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after he running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I saw Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did you see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're making it with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I was introduced to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I commit to his brother and his father in that right now, "All right, this is <unk> Tony <unk> going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner can't be able to do it.
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer. Do you draw about that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of you start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, then people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One is playing to the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from every corner of the corner to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage garage and these <unk> and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have removed the pictures of the walls and in their place, it would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part, my dog was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
So we took a <unk> camera, we put it on a <unk> we put it on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up -- we published the code -- the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There are no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture, because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of science <unk> of all night, Tony turned back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a slide on a projector on a wall out of the outside of the hospital.
And he started drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lots.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot so that we felt like we were <unk> by graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like it would have been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
And in a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in the movement, but it is what it keeps us on it.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and make it faster and make it.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 birthday, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the greatest <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be at the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do you get <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with the <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was passionate about wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, I'm going to go, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to <unk> hard.
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
It plays in <unk> <unk> areas.
And I spent 30 days to have just -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been involved in situations in the same time with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a report in <unk>
And I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered by selling the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes and according to content could be <unk> in your face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, this is a very good chance.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy her name.
If you had asked me a year ago I could have been able to tell you for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said before, I've been involved in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could do it as difficult as you get to the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to <unk> product <unk> marketing and advertising, and that the whole film would be <unk> with <unk> of marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, at the beginning of the end, has got images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It's more by <unk>
Was it <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we have all of the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you can make a shoe and become the most cool shoe that you have <unk>
The most cool car you've ever driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the film of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
I don't know how responsive is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but that certainly is going to be worth caring for a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: JK: Two things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to give the product to as many people as possible as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, not the idea of that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no error at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you're looking for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like the <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians did the <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to really do something something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>  like that bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to have a story, but <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and there he is he looking at me as long as he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
Is your story, it's my story, and there's the present story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, one agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out to be the proxy and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and that I began to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies have so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> at the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can tell you, "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You're a little nervous.
I want you to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like to stick with solid, to stick with a bar, like it.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer their questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
It will be <unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we have, we're more good at <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind you to <unk> people is the reason that we are interested in.
MS: What words would use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps me cool.
How do we keep you fresh longer? With better <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, and people like me, to <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like your <unk>
Volunteer: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand.
<unk> something unique -- <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors -- many gray colors and things like that.
Usually I wear brown <unk> or I like the crystals and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2:
Woman 2: In some <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of the pet guy.
They <unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because I was <unk>
Man 5: Get <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a lawyer.
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an <unk>
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit like your thoughts and feelings like it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk>
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that you think about, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come from, and start in a place and in my case where they start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next thing is "This was the best day of my life."
A: does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like things different.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> <unk> for what is that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> is right now?
Why is it important -- what is the <unk>
So we were a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be scared. What kind of mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. Look at Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to get out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk>
They get very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think some companies will only be stuck in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> prevents those elements of fear, those elements and you actually give them something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are marks and <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and come out, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to make your identity identity, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more good at an <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> bold or audacious as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred and wise ones, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to become part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control of the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story about this movie of how now they use MRI to identify the centers of desire to identify the brain centers in the brain so much for a movie for movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have forbidden the <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting becoming a way in the schools with available money problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've interacted with are those who I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to try with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it have gone? They have success?
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the film was sent out, in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is not <unk>
There's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talked about, would not be a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are pushing them into failure.
I think that when you train your employees in loss <unk> is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately we need to track transparency.
More than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so, in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a phenomenal question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED, the Foundation <unk> a check for <unk> to be applied to my support for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how to discover this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you know is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we would <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory of lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after we experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for an active box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working in that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say, for example, a power plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> on two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much to bring the operator.
So they know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, <unk> technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
Basically it boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants.
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and confuse it in an obvious way to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to look at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better enough.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in their hands.
So that hasn't been <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken away after several weeks of work.
<unk> <unk> at dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would have a single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> communicates with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really I was going to look at me.
There's the gray, and the top line you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the values of the sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides <unk> code which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's kind of like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber is <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators of the control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes down at speed, you have to open heat valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot be a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And we don't have the <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> plant.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> to disseminate this load with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It will be more possible.
And if you did that, with what you find is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we are going to get to prepare it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> tape.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and that I give <unk> skills, or another thing that makes users of the wheels come up and come back and go back and go away.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great strength, which is going to increase its speed, and they help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds for a few hours.
Its flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then you get my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs of the wheels, which I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people in chairs, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often too young people with damage to the spinal column that we started their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We are also talking about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
His only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't walk back 19 years back, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors in it.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals on on board on board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give the engines in the <unk> and on the knees, and make it move forward with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing down the bottom is <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost every sense and all motion from <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down to <unk> rocks and even ride on the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life in future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs from wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say, hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Spiderman.
Ladies and gentlemen, they meet his cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in Congo.
<unk> are, along with the chimps, their closest kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been taken over for decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also putting the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation makes you fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes, apes -- love, not because they have frequent <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us, and for them the game is critical to establish links and encourage the <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the same laughter, the dance and the ritual humans.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of only unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sex play is common as well as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female female, who is playing with water <unk>
I think like her, sometimes we play themselves, and explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And this playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take it back to our own game?
The game is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which the most urgent thing is the most urgent thing.
For that, fellow primates, embrace this gift of evolution and <unk> together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, 60,000 fires as a captain of the captain in a fire <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are inspired by a highly specialized staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But even so there was a career on the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were in broad night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and save the dog's dog dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered in a burning building to save a living building for me because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go to the house.
I need you to do it <unk> you get the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was waiting for, but I had the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at that height or less they had finished on the fire and walked into the main room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog in the front door.
We got out of the house the treasures that treasures for home where, as he expected, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from my home house -- by the brave effort you have demonstrated to save his house.
And the kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a voluntary fireman I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also from grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are they going to be done -- remarkable levels of success would like to remind you to remind you to remind you to remind you.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you have something to give, you have something to give, you have something to give, you have something to give, you have something to give.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of concrete.
The first concrete blocks of concrete they built in <unk> with a very simple idea, of concrete modules that fit with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He called him brick of assembly <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or house.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would lead us from a world of aesthetic bricks and piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex circuits at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they join by magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the current, the pink is the entrance and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and you can very quickly start making older circuits.
A blue one with a green make light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having a program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster, or slower or slow, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all interactions in the world to join bricks and <unk>
(Audience: <unk> solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an <unk> is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers at Rhode Island, who had no experience in engineering, only in cardboard and wood and paper and said, "Do you take something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the reach of all.
It has an open source.
You can go on the website and you can download all the design files and you can <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking to engage with the environment focusing on.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you know, I think this is what the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to get a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is about showing the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a book in Boston.
Here it appears as if I was looking at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone would be caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good at fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to ask for aid in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we were very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the right sidewalks in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it extends <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> city City, when you see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to take the <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So he asks the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just sent to you to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
<unk> acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done for the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that at the time that two million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has been in a couple of days and it's spreads in a viral way is a kind of shot by warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in a open, <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as an collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they would engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to <unk> applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but you don't get out of it.
And these people know something that we've lost of view.
And that is that if you stop aside the feelings of politics, you line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that you get crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't know.
Now, many people have <unk> government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not going to get the government.
And because the government ultimately made out of -- you remember that <unk> the way I think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of telephone care and information <unk>
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
<unk> <unk> on the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, put music hard and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a website and a mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't <unk> that application.
It was the very intelligent people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this was really, actually coming up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights.
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income for government income, distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services, but the neighbor is better and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, we support the communities.
If we call the animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people get it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry into the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will turn our values into our values, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps us that that belongs to that we funded as something that is operating in our against, that something else, and in a consequence of a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the government machine.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've <unk> them.
It's a group of citizen concerned that they have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the name of the <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism it's activism as well.
And for those of us who have been <unk> in government, is time that we ask what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of everyone else.
We can't do it, and we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to root the root to root the government function so that it can expand to civil society <unk>
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years so that I, to <unk> I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, they're going to speak.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care much about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They are hands to program to program applications that make applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking off <unk> dumping a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have <unk> those fish, and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get the services.
We're more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until it doesn't make the citizen <unk>
So I want to ask all of the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a ton of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Again, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make sense, but if they teach themselves to feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a African-American family dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way the world looked like.
She was a hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little, and I looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
And I got so hard I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was telling him that no, I went back again and said, yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to pick up his time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it, and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room, and he said, "Come <unk> and he said, "Come on. We are two going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I would say I didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just do I want you to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to think about is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I'll do that."
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want me to ask me, is that you're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is to be it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do that."
And then finally he said, "The third I want me to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I will do that."
I grew up in the field, in the <unk> I have a brother a year older and sister a younger year.
When I was 14 15, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went and went for the forest.
We just came up with the <unk> <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. And I'm not going to get <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I'm going to tell you, and you always do the same as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I went up with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I'm saying by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has completely changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In the urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore -- Washington -- Washington -- from 50 to 60 percent of all the color of color are in prison or parole.
Our system is not just distorted before race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is so much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The policy of fear and the anger make us believe that these are not problems.
We are disconnected.
I find interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty good developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, just as in other other states, you care about rights forever, if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right now to the vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years that the level of the loss of the water loss will be as high as before they <unk> the law law to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he sentence children in 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance to go out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They killed people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense of us have <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is innocent and liberated from death row.
One of a mistake, <unk> an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you would never allow you to fly planes if in every nine that <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history -- I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
Actually, we don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was an defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are some older people who come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're talking about talks, makes you <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our own history for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And this is why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany leading about death row.
And it was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and he said, "You know it's okay to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we would put us to run people.
Let's think about this.
How do we feel a nation in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love our entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that you never get to TED.
And if you think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are, despite being so rational, so committed to intellectual life.
With innovation, the development comes not just of brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This is the connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will to be in paper sites and being <unk>
Well, that guidance for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect that is related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity, than if we ignored these things.
So we go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> we're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and get it.
I said, "I know I said, "I know <unk>
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I went and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences of life, with no freedom for the children.
We tried to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of it, very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that is not <unk> not to be a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be replaced by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> that we don't judge ourselves for our technology, for our design, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and powerful ones -- but by the way they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly deep issues about what we are.
And sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> for them as adults were born.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How could a judge have a judge going to turn someone into what is it?
The judge would use it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late was <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customers.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black client is treated as a privileged <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there have been a behavioral conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical <unk> but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream -- or actually the <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> but he had sent the court.
For about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I was finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go through this case stupid.
I got into the car, and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down the car. <unk> the court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, she came up to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "You know, I said, "You know, I said yes.
And then they <unk> me and <unk>
And I got into the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
The judge came to me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> me." And we started argue.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy crazy things.
They come to the policemen the prosecutors -- the <unk>
And suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all mad because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
Just look out the window, and you would hear that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the board table.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran across the old black man.
He said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, "Let's go to this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep her sight in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, in those of you who are sharing this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close together.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to do a effort to test the funds that are spent today in the political policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The rapes of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the law to the law, to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge drop in <unk> in the U.S., in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war.
That's why it emerges this dramatic increase in the population itself.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> chain by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against the property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to make the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment is nothing done by anyone.
I think that's the guidance that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited about us today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> This is just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses is getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be done.
And as nothing else is about to survive, the first stop in all of this data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could do harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories to be looking at the worse.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be bad at worse.
But it may not be like this.
Maybe, in return, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress in the last century by a series of forces is characterized by such a potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> of water and <unk> without any doubts we have.
As human beings, we are very good at taking care of problems, and in the long run, we just did with them.
Let's look at what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita has continued for inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy spent 25 percent over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to choose higher and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water toilets, <unk> <unk> phones, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubles the price of price at about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer than 70.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the output computers that are used to build fast computers.
It doesn't stop against any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's going up.
The rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's an extraordinarily powerful set of technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and sensors, the printing system and its ability to democratize and to distribute personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuel and the food, the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I sought up in the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to competitors <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> on the planet, it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops were Napoleon <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, more than the gold and the <unk>
And for that reason the tip of the Washington century is from aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal in it.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made it something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It will take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is called by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They arrive at the Earth 16 energy <unk> every <unk> minutes.
This is not a hurricane, but it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour.
And if we have abundance of energy we have also abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars by water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed the spaceship to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
I had a famous picture. How do you get <unk>
"A pale pale point.
Because we live on a planet water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the water <unk> on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that is available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> their technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a refrigerator size.
It is able to generate 1,000 gallons of drinking water on the day of any <unk> saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that I'm going to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have some confidence that this is how to be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
So this is a <unk> innovation, because of this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the developing world at the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in Kenya than the Reagan Reagan 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smart smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> images, <unk> images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best time it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies on a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> can be extracted from the blood of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
So when this device would be <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't be able to call the health of our health, and first of all, avoiding the epidemic.
But this is the largest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
So we just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been before they add to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three million more members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
What about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and they can act for the first time?
What do you do? These three billion?
And if they're contributions that we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that young teams of their passion for their passion with a goal of course, can do things that were <unk> things that they could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out the way that the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've been playing with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up with each other.
And it has shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion of our new minds that we get together to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The point of starting place.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described to one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it so much to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red List of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still says they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: shift in the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a waste in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The waste was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 feet, the black screen.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made over half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had been dropped in half.
Go back to five centimeters high.
We have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well it started in <unk> Europe made a lot of developmental projects.
<unk> development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> fishing fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, it was called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in southern China Sea, and above all, in the sea <unk>
What we captured there was a little <unk>
<unk> now I know the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were coral, other animals that are on the background.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs of tiny blobs of remains that are fish of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then start the commercial farming.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
And once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But no <unk>
You get the world, but we don't remember it.
It will start the point of starting -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you go to this, this happens something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, the number of killer whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation is to use the images that I received in the beginning of your conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end of the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in a big extent, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies have killed animals without knowing what they have done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is unusual.
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a smaller sea of large fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way that they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them have, as captain as captain such and such a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually not use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that you can see a protected marine area.
Because in marine marine areas, we really sort of recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of departure.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a <unk> simulation simulation simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay -- 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people are just <unk> the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only thing to give, is it to be: to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made viral and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today this video video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our world's culture.
Anyone can be done in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only a little percentage is viral gets countless visits and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> of trends, of participation communities and factor surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this footage outside his house in the National Park <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of popularity of popularity last summer.
They were not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this adage that he <unk> the video to popularity
The trends like Jimmy <unk> are present and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, on Friday.  You have to start on a Friday.   You all want to get the end of a week, the weekend.                    <unk> Friday. You would not have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday of a <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators take a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's it, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know that there's a <unk> version that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, it came a whole community of someday, which made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> or <unk> or Black Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What do you script might have written this situation?
In a world where you go two days a minute, just that is really unique and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't interested in it.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> because they don't circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that are active with the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> was able to get five million saw and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth for everything new we do in a creative way.
And all this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity wealth.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, and it's just the current media, but <unk> the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> comes into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally not alone.
So the words, for so long -- friends, now <unk>
It is <unk> in silence.
He died broken for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be treated but I would <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and a marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four years that I defies fiction, a boat turned into the sea <unk> of ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were born, first we would take it out of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the horizon and vast <unk>
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the motor dying and not to start to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the entire platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and died, end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike suburbia in the middle class whose existence I was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English is being traded among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, <unk>
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title of the <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was generally <unk> she was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide holes from the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me, <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and we were hearing the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would come up to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make <unk> angry and <unk> and boys are stuck in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what <unk> of myself.
In the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lives, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I was choosing the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges wouldn't be <unk>
<unk> anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in homes whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the physics and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> about the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and they won't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they would be living in the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new come in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, perhaps a gift of the boat.
Because being inside may easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not in the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was a energy there, such a <unk> kind of mixture of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
I would go back to a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, he was making a giant box of soup that all of us.
It will do all the way up to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant <unk> and we open to us.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when he won.
It can't be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 kilometers, in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who were and how life we set up to us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could do that for it?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy part.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that you don't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here today, in the fourth or fifth line.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a chariot and put them the sky.
Now we do it with aircraft.
And at that time when we <unk> the big prince Indian warrior -- he was <unk> I took a <unk> and with a <unk> on the ground, he was able to get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I took this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic to not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me a silver <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense of that the mobile <unk> and the cameras from the cameras from prevent them from it.
Let's make our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I threw myself into this technological world to see how to create magic, rather than killing her.
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device capable of connecting the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And this --  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several moments, I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that it comes to me.
My little girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons, but to that magic of childhood -- to those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar they were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what the book is.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all book, I've always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary side.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras from Indra for millennia, in an old and damp book.
So we're bringing them back into a childhood story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids are gone.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in one chapter, you would get a picture of a flower and then you get to <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so it creates a digital collection of photos that then can be put on the Web.
A little boy in London, put a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy of India says, "I'm going to see a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, the Earth and the technology is so many possibilities.
In the next book, we can have an interaction where you get out of the iPad and the video on and through <unk> reality sees a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside plants in the house.
And at a moment the screen is filled with leaves is <unk>
And you have to make the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
So we're going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology to come up with one another.
It will be energy from the sun.
We're moving to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and love and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> what <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> are failing, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I am <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I was <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but I saw it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect myself to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week I'm going to be available to the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will go from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they get their blood pressure, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but we can also help health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the health care costs and other issues.
So techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs have <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> in order to help this patient?
We asked but no one is <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, you know, sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and you can use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to go on global level.
We are <unk> to all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're out of vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies all over the world that could help us witness these <unk>
It could be <unk> or people in <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
He mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera was in my planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> and <unk> in the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
I think you're going to have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that is going to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real real?
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic thing.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it was there.
But, at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look realistic in which I think are those things that we don't even know -- things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they took the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect union <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that is still because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew that I was a number of months to go to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of rock.
And yes, I even did the <unk> house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think you need to be planning.
You always start with an idea.
And then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and in a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start by showing a slide on technology, very boring.
If they can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder, mine.
I'm not so interested in showing you the details but the overall aspect of the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
And the interesting thing about this is that this one, like a lot of other things that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves -- it's something new.
Here's a little bit strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to take you back, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, any other technology, like transport, in a curved curve, it would be very dumb, would look at a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is as fast as the <unk> of <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological growth, that every few years advance of magnitude. orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So we would have one of two things.
Or is it going to become a typical curve, and I know that it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we are now in the middle of a transition.
This line is a transition from what it used to be the world, into a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is: what is that new way that <unk> the world?
Why new is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're embedded in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been doubling year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that transition could be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back to a few billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that we would fly around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals -- we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and it's that, at that time, there were some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes on it.
Some of those drops of oil droplet was a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring up materials from the outside, and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell shapes -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow are getting better at the time to bring chemical chemicals back into the other time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals and get more <unk>
Mostly they lived more long, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things became interesting when these drops to these drops the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this kind of meaningless evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to figure out what they were for <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and I would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
The writing was an interesting step.
This is made that these cells were happy another billion years.
But then there was another great step in which things got very different -- and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information to form from cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, the antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together together and set up a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community they were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities got to come up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next big stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't just act alone.
The skin cell is not for the heart of the heart, or the muscles of muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and more interesting levels of cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level of our communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making information in the community.
They're brain structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities are going to be.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for instance, learn how to eat some fruits because I knew bad and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures out of this evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saves some analogy with mine.
But we took a very complicated thing to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
Now we went through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms <unk> our <unk> methods and presentation of information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer <unk> the video tape, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And we aggregate that in something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And we've now accelerated time time again.
The first stages of history that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The 1970s, the language, they took less than a million years.
And the following, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I do a lot of my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent advanced advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor makes each transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine, and the machine with that does something that you didn't could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions. And they would run all those programs, and take those things that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to answer numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions. It would get numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did <unk>
And they would take those and get them to the rest.
And now you know, the best they ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will make the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I would give it a few mutations to us.
And it tries to go again and get it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfectly perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to show you how they work.
These are strangers.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the fact that they get the target because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that we succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls out a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the options that we have.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
So it is <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've been spending enough time to allow me to give up part of my fake status in that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
Is it out of <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that we have immunized it.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it into the first base, it doesn't get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three acres of 10.
You know what you call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, actually, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that is 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the very very <unk> Ted <unk> the last player of the Cuban League <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I think this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and one being wanted to have two coronary arteries <unk> and their family physician derived it to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But know what?
She's getting a remarkably much better.
And their <unk> have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think of you who should be the average of a heart surgeon or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the <unk> of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I thought when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a mate in high school, he said that Brian Goldman studying until a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of our memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> frequent <unk>
And I even knew the partial diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were looking at everything, then would you know everything, or as possible, close to all, because I get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency service in the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room consult a cardiologist to me to go to that patient.
And I'm reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave them <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave them <unk> pills so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to give up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my side that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unable to ask the nurse who <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
It was that he signed up the high and the ambulance with the ambulance with her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I went to leave to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home, and I did something that I don't do normally, normally I did something that I don't do normally, normally I do something that I don't do normally, normally I do something that I don't do normally, normally I do something that I
I went through the emergency service service at home.
And there was another nurse, not that I was talking about Mrs. <unk> before, but another one -- he told me three words, those three words that most physicians in <unk>
Other specialists who are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school and he suffered his family and his family called the <unk> the ambulance and brought it into emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
I just wanted to breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff, all of its resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
I had a mixture of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that we never will.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let him go.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks ago, I was struck by that, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and felt lonely, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that it leaves a teaching.
Shame is what I'm talking about is that that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad guys.
And that meant it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would love things and made sure that I didn't get to me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why he sent her house?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little recently that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on a day <unk> opened up the sky and finally wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were going to get the efforts to be perfect to make no more errors, would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, he was an hour, in the emergency department in a community hospital north in Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years old with an pain on your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little <unk>
He took him penicillin and he sent him back to his house.
But while he was running the door still to point out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my belly change -- my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by an pain in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had an potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but the upper airline goes down, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
And fortunately, he didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered in a few days.
And I walked across the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back and went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same shift in the E.R. <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they would get 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
We had an X-ray shot, but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague who was checking out to the patient perceived to be sort of sensitivity.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He got a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it, and when you saw some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand quadrant, I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and how many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you, and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you teach this to not make the same <unk>
If I went into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party, you will hear from errors in other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, trust me that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who are <unk> they can't sleep and the ones that they can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal medical study and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first paper that I wrote to Toronto, "Star <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 medications <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right in a system where chronic infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and more <unk>
In this country, 5,000 Canadian medical errors are killed by medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
And in both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is doubling every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with an pain in my chest, and it comes to <unk> eyes, and I breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminated all the professionals as opposed to error, well, it won't be anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, art -- it's a habit of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my <unk> <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students would <unk> to go down, go down the head and deliver saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, human knows -- they accept it, they accept it, and it's not proud of their errors, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It would make the mistakes of other people not <unk> but in a loving way for everybody to get out of it.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make errors once at time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, it will make errors mistakes.
And I feel so much -- but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average number of elections that says to pick a half American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot ago, in research followed for a week to a group of businesses.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that they were going to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more than time.
Now think about their choices.
You know how many people belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How do we <unk> the way that we deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to talk about to the <unk> of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, you raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you do a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was wondering, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf of <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different kinds of different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
And I once decided to go to the manager and I asked him, "Let's get this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> right at the entrance to the tent.
We put it out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors different and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
This is the opposite effect.
From the ones that stopped when there was only 24 percent of it got to buy <unk>
What you stood up when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, you decide that we don't buy <unk> we would probably get <unk> -- it's less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> options affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the topic of day, the financial saving is.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at decisions about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money offers available in savings plans, for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was that the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you get more choices, even in that case, there are bad consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
As much as they had more choices, they were more willing to invest in online financial prices.
But none of these exciting decisions are the ones that we are going to get together to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in the health.
They're more likely to pick things out more likely to pick up things, even though objectively going to tell you better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that <unk> variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choose about that incredible <unk>
Today I want to propose to you about four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so they can rehearse in their businesses.
The first is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> <unk> there will be a <unk> increase.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products of cats that fewer <unk> they rose up <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower costs.
You know that today's supermarkets provide 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, they provide about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is David <unk> David <unk> <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a very high fund of life.
Those who really want choice, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there is between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with every single paid road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take a round of applause. If you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second -- but I can tell you that you thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images would make it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the motor <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average on average when they use debit cards or credit than when they used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting exactly as <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to think about the positive things that they would take in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts on <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine room.
We saw that in retail supermarkets throughout the corridor of <unk> the display of magazines can contain from <unk> different guys to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right one is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right one is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that you don't know that the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
He was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think about if we just get it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German company of cars that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put up the car.
And these things vary in the number of options that offers each each.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go out of a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you are.
If you always get the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that those who go from a lot of choices to fewer, <unk> the <unk> button and over again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from little choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the changes don't say anything about the preferences of <unk> inside of all ways they made us for choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that we now have more engaged with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> to get rid of alternate choices, <unk> to make it <unk> We can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been introduced were designed to help handle the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful the best we are in our choices best can be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years in the East Germany in East Germany -- if you had a piece of writing should be <unk> in the government.
I had to register a sheet of text that was written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much that this is going to get to freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and you print this page up by having a few yellow dots on each page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from New York City in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to win a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Matthew Anderson, Anderson, etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media using banking to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a crime that was a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by money.
There's another thing that the moves, you motivate the protests, you motivate you the opinions, you make laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a role in the attacks online.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who are doing to protest and the last group are the United Nations, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an evil authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
It would drop the fall last fall because of a <unk>
We would take the safety of the site and make it a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with representative government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of an opinion of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April <unk> and during <unk> in the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, they found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the officials of the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes further.
They were <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to look at all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully, in things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument does not make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right, any right to deal with today, will be forever.
They invest blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions you must be worried about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, and the back of the cow, and the National Park Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only time we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and the whole land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying of the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for their father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because he even helped male lions see the <unk>
I don't think <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I tried to trick male lions to believed that he was near the <unk>
But male lions are really smart.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were there, but the second day, and they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day male lions were not.
I discovered that lions are afraid to the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn on and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a flashlight <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box. I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> to male lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood would have the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've built them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also is used now by all Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used by elephants.
And because of this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, Medical School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds.
I even took my friends into my community and installed lights in the houses they don't have, and I teach them how to do it.
So a year ago, it was just a child on the Olduvai <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes, and he said to me that someday would be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when it up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented by building electrical makers but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would have a little bit of it, and I'm going to look at it, and I have tried it before, but I got a couple of it, because I got a <unk>  CA: Oh, <unk> Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We go to <unk> every single step of my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> anything."
And I felt so proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I spent all my life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public hospital.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
And when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms looking at his face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during hunger, and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They were also made more and more frequent <unk> all my stuff was completely dark, in night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans, across <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I walked out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives to live with.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North American refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was struck by the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But he managed to control my emotions and asked questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official said to another, "This was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for sanctuary in 60s.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after you learn a new language and find work, all your world can be solved in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be putting up going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a big challenge of what I expected for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Poles.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even walked through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that I could call out of my life.
Even though I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the hospital exam for college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little money that sent my family, and as a punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a crash location in the <unk>
They had to get away from immediately immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border in North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put them in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught multiple times.
Once, our bus was stopped and treated by a official police officer.
He asked the <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards.
But even after the border, my family was arrested and locked around the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the South Korea.
I was going and came in between the immigration office, and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care about.
With my poor English English and a dictionary, I explained to the situation, and no <unk> the man was to the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other North Koreans and get them to prison.
I met with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown stranger -- a new hope for me and for the people who are getting more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the amount of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community to education, practice language language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in touch with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the south.
This is Center -- <unk> stores of <unk> food, rapid terrain.
So the planners of the city got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles as if this is actually <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles  <unk> of <unk> food, fast terrain.
Like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles south south of food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that food places to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles in Los Angeles there.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 kilometers away.
I emphasize to see that happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> wheels, and sold as cars as cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of managing 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what come to me in won, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest -- <unk> -- you know, nine fresh vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group paid for gardeners of all the <unk> across the entire city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city has been <unk> and <unk> gave me a <unk> by saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made up to <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  So I was like, "Okay, let's look at it.
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called the <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more terrain <unk>
It's about 68 miles of terrain.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's a space that is enough to plant <unk>
Why don't you look good at this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars to happen.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is like you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up in there. <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> from that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if you let your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how they affect people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education, of my own neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You can see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and his daughter, and she was like the night <unk> and they were in my garden, and I went out and looked at them very <unk>
I said, "Well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, "Do you say, "Well, you don't assume that people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
That's what the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to do it <unk>
There was another chance I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, and this was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people coming from, work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If kids are <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this is being told if you are not taught how food is affecting the mind and your body, eat blind to what you put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're done. I see color kids who are on this road designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get out of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take it back and turn them into healthy sneakers.
I don't get surprised.
I'm not talking about free stuff, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
And what I'm talking about is putting people out of the street, to get the kids out of the street, the pride and the honor and the honor to grow their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners were <unk>
We have to change the script that is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material for driving, but not always, especially not in days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you get in.
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars go go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so that all water water is going down the sides and they will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they don't waste water.
The noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that on this road the rocks the surface of the surface <unk>
First of all, a rock and more and more, and so on, and then -- well, I won't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
Oh. It's smart.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see what the damage is in this material.
It's an asphalt <unk> as I said, so there's only a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light, this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to be <unk> and <unk>
So if you're driving down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk>
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you've got to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will come back back to the surface.
Today I was using a <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine, here's the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So we gave a set of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane lane to test this material.
So that's what we did in there. You see where the test on the road -- and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made it aging at the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then the <unk> later with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers and incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the ground, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curious about whether it worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before you can show you how the repair.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC in his little gray radius of his gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban would <unk> she screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were lifted out of Afghanistan and they made their girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I would love me as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
And we all knew that we were <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
In a while, school was suddenly closed by a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, <unk> where his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is it.
He left two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our own neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first one family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get them to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we shall.
So, you still don't want to do it.
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, it was one of the first in <unk>
He's not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I wear on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams of <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's so <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite them and even in front of an opposition one.
It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go from the way from <unk> towards her village, and literally they went out of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if she kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, often these are the first compelling characteristics of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school count on <unk> remember, they were illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
You know, these changes would not last too much, after retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls in the <unk> I got it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution, inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were at the middle -- the each of the <unk> regime, <unk> for freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a bravery copy when you face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses in about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> a <unk> transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and <unk>
This was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique <unk> I began to organize workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> of guidance in order to advocate for the women's women's autonomy and our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was <unk> from <unk> policies of domination and <unk>
And over time, our initiative was powerfully and successfully.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and graves <unk>
Another day with the news of the U.S. ambassador, and the attack in the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and its nonstop violations.
Our society, made out of a <unk> mentality it becomes more <unk> and it has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by <unk> policies of domination and <unk> as well as women for women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the choices needed to do is that we just push polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female as the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage and call it a day of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also put it into practical practice, instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, they <unk> rather than the <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to reach the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in the existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that involves all the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all existence.
So he goes, "My mercy looks at all of the things."
This is how it says, "My tapir is prevalent about my <unk>
That they were all given to us the <unk> of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a problem with a question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones that all make the same way. Why should she be left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I thought I was creating my soul <unk> I loved my head with a <unk> loaded with bullets <unk>
The man, when I loved anybody in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap in love, where each year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English University and I have a <unk> in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the checklist: <unk> list between them and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years old with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, every religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is going to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> or said otherwise, in families, the last place where we wish or expect to find <unk> for which, whereas the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to stay with a man who would come up with a man who holds it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, November night of January.
I was sitting next to my feet in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university <unk> and who worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did was, from the beginning, it was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, I would put passion to help girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the degree of that <unk> and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a <unk> financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how they react to.
And this is where those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to feel so safe I bought three guns.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns because of the trauma that lived with small ones.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those gun were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted my hand, my life was already seriously serious about each day.
The first physical attack came back five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit and married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we lived happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of sense that by the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
He had been a isolated accident, and it never would be hurt.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he brought me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I thought that was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control report that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> manage their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because us, the victims, we know something that you normally have, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally moved to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other aftermath include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned from financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who usually are compelled for judges to spend time not to spend their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> I will beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if she was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody in the world: to the police, my neighbors and my family and familiar family, and I'm here today because all of you have helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines, <unk> women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you do?"
So some people is a way to say "The fault is <unk> as if the victims are <unk> intentionally <unk> people who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a vivid lesson of what happened to them, and they will redesign their lives happy and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became marrying with a cute little man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have never ever else, you would ever have a charged gun pointing to my head in somebody who says I want me to.
At this moment, they're just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid -- but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to right now, which are being <unk> or they were either being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting their daughter, his sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love crazy love silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
RNA abuse is only in silence.
They have the power of ending up in domestic violence, simply shedding light on it.
The victims of the world need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
And the abuse of the light is talking about it with their children, their colleagues of work, their friends and family.
You know, the vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down your climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our homes, our tables and our families in the oasis safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name's Cameron Cameron and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed up like that.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them now, but I find it more late on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to happen this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as you cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed fully what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I was going to go back and make the hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there's very little that we can do to transform our look, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave is to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a legacy, and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my rational heritage that I've known to take money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing you, and maybe there are some people who are <unk> that <unk> <unk> These are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at University of New York, I told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models just -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can you be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would really tell you about each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and poet, which would be impressive, because you were the first.
If after this list, it's still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be model that you want to win the lottery when you are larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose to.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, whether unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've taken your studies, and you have a copy and a couple of jobs on your backs, no matter what you think about, if you will, you want to be president of the United States, but you have a little bit of <unk> in the United States, but your people would look <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, you basically get all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was looking at, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to give them things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and never use, except the couple before before, but the privilege I get out are the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped a red light light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege by my view, not why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times are I going to be <unk>
By doing this talk for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to <unk> percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we did it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to be able to work with creative, creative and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never call in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask you, you know, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair, I will be <unk>
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brightest and the <unk> hair, but it's probably the <unk> women on the planet.
But most of it was hard to analyze a situation of racial racial and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to keep from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go and I didn't get the <unk>
There were no <unk> or <unk> or a chance to repeat the pictures, even a very small deal in the lighting light.
In fact, most of them took random tourists at random.
My story starts in a while, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me up this picture to my daughter in his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> trip and you drive the <unk>
Here is when we started to ask for tourists that were going to get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger to be so universal.
No one has been refused and fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of particular or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us think about our age and our evolution over the years, and not just on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something we expect with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around when all of a sudden, it was stuck in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the owner of dolls that <unk> from small <unk>
And he described to me that there was the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded their heart <unk> with strength to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in creating conscious of memories.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets a picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you didn't get to get close to somebody and asked him, and you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the most <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney <unk> <unk> like silly <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There's the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the West <unk> and the Old World <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why do the <unk> are important? First provide vital ecological services.
They are our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria help to absorb the anthrax that they would not be used and cause huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the UN and under Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and <unk> his life to save the <unk> goddess of <unk>
In the culture of <unk> they are made very important <unk> in the open culture, and in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead in the dead, so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on livestock <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned to wear in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in the middle of dogs -- in <unk> and when you have dogs in <unk> you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased enormous in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Okay, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a sustainable problem is not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can they become <unk> can make noise.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw them flying without effort, without the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and all that I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa de <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, which the Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we came up with the seeds of <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local <unk> growing tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, the people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were allowed to come to work, and sometimes they didn't <unk>  We were aware that the local <unk> in such fertile fertile valley, they didn't have to have agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that you didn't know anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk>
So we've got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato production would grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> look at how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You don't <unk>
I thought that only we have the Italians were going to get mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what the English did, what they did and then to see what the French would do, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  -- <unk> to see the waste that will inspire them to <unk> people from Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've given to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
They just read his book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I'm dealing with all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little little <unk> written by <unk> who said by especially economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at the age of 27 years just answering the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never drives anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do that? <unk>
You can never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a cafe. We sit down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do it?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, at once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why did they do not -- but not in meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which is what a chance have identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face faces, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The career is the family doctor, the family doctor, who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this junk junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to ask for asking, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I was <unk> and I would say that.  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we're going to make <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk with you.
You have to give you a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the end, and then you start to come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
So what do you talk to you have <unk> more this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution in the end of the first industrial revolution that is <unk> <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution.
government? <unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a fantastic story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States appeared -- generic manufacturing companies, <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very fewer, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute, <unk> service.
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to count with a fantastic financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met one human being in the world that can do, sell and search for money.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We have looked at the 100 known companies of the Carnegie world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: none of them started by one person.
No word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who came from a small business of small business <unk> in <unk> with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what will you do for your gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who is going to ask you, what will it take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that he looks at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share our hopes of cows for empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, I am in love with New York City.
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And the city is always supporting music.  There is a runway in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful links in the world, but also one with the highest number of U.S. <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a deep gratitude for the time and the living time.
It led to the most significant things about my current life.
But I will get to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up for day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted it on her phrases for me she was ready to die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before she died, I want to be tested by <unk>  Before they died, I want to sit on <unk> on the <unk> line.
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die, I want to figure it once again."
Before I die I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has been constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they loved me, and they gave me comfort on hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about supporting the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have gone walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, finding the ways of conserving the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that would become more power.
If you think about death death, our life.
Our shared spaces can be able to reflect better what we care about individuals and as a community and with more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, and very hot.
Don't speak, but it is increasing joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It shares a little bit -- pass on what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious and religious differences in this: he has never <unk>
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even think of, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but he remembers the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, <unk> in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which was autistic autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way of a different way, and it will be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that are faster in the world, there is no cause or no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
Let's get a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
They lived in life and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that had <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences was made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been a few difficult moments in my family, times when I had wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back at the things that I've been taught about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change for normal.
The normal thing about the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in their interior, and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dying in the moment that we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their very unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, and I really surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the health and care environment among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists like scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but they study <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to understand it.
And when you're describing your science, carefully with the <unk>
The jargon is a obstacle for our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them stupid as well.
Otherwise, as Einstein, said, which is all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do next?"
An <unk> like this is not just boring, but it is supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows than the special <unk> structure of <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the only design of the Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that will make our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they are <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all the means -- <unk> <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the U.S. <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an <unk> publisher, in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge -- no matter or <unk> and that, when he won, they get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something you do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
He brought him in the London Tower and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to return to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
And they were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it a <unk> state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it a <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And even if they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a given deadline.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired -- <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
I read a day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be able to Washington become power.
They didn't want to call it King -- if he was given to him or his sister, ideas.
So they wanted to give her the most <unk> more <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was before, but it just meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were native presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take them seriously with a degree as ridiculous and insignificant as the President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> as a title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this thing I want to suggest to you, is that the President of the United States is not that modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial air vehicles and so on.
reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, he won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually reality fundamentally changes the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground.
The air is loaded and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones with <unk> tools.
As others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light, strapped into the head with this rubber rubber rubber shell, and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole from a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
He was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a farmer, I met days before, who lost the control and fell 3,000 feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole -- their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never enjoy it, because they're prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the G8 Summit of <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> from <unk> the <unk> a nonprofit which is going to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I felt really <unk> I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me a little bit like a stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of them even, I thought my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slave slave trafficking.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a number of <unk> today.
However, today, you can borrow entire families for generations for <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they are forced to work without who who were forced under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today that slavery is operating in <unk> the <unk> products of slaves have value, but those who produce these are disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost the whole world, and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like entering ancient Egypt or <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a <unk> heavy <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no breaks to eat, and not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and <unk> and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me so clearly that I demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
It could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted that he was <unk>
As soon as I waited home to feel my heart <unk>
And in the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles by <unk> to trucks who were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who were loaded and the kids <unk> their heads up to their heads with leashes <unk> made from <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness -- I would think it would be hard for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
And he took me on the stairs <unk> that they would go to this dirty, dirty, <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as being known in the craft, are local to practice <unk>
They have small, private, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to come and entertain the clients and educate them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark, <unk> and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a fear <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they were going.
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no window enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we played a hard subject -- it's important to point out that the slavery -- even sexual trafficking, happens to us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the home and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 Americans and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slave death.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
textiles are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families going on on the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The white <unk> hands are from the father, and the <unk> and the red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake at the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went into a quick look.
I saw what seemed like to be a fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some young children -- some young kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all the slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake despite not to know swim.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> the subject that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of fall to water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, it's thrown into the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> treated the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the other.
In the cold night and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because of the way that someone decided to make a difference in their life?
We were born by a road in Ghana with the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
They asked us to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
Then you get this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to <unk> we took off the <unk> that we would kick the road and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of my head on my head as you put in these waters up to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> my way ended up <unk> in one of it, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football camp, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs, and while looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember he looked at his eyes, tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people carry together carrying heavy stone bags and then they'll be attached to another area where they would be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying of his uncle, the uncle, the debt of the uncle will be able to be slave on mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines and the injury of the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet, to that, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dream to be liberated and educated with help with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of developmental determination, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will get witness to them and we'll make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're about people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these so many beautiful people, beautiful people, I've had the great honor to know.
So I hope these images showed a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that it turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make the math math -- and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management services.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today I'm trying to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But the demands of a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a ballet dancer ballet syndrome.
Over the last few years we have gotten a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and a <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement have no biological markers -- so they don't have blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic, it's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam test themselves?
It wouldn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to you to you is, as a way not conventional to a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration at <unk>
It shows someone healthy as he emits sounds by talking about, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that would be required.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child learning to speak.
From the sound from sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as well as the Parkinson's is affecting the limbs also affect the <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes happier and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests in the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they are both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole bunch of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. Well, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost that is so <unk> it appears on the mass scale.
These are some amazing ready ready to address.
We can reduce the patient <unk>
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> <unk>
With high monitoring we might be able to get objective data.
We could make a massive <unk> mass of clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give up today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Public <unk> Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's, you can call it low and leave recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached three percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples from, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data attached to different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy of accuracy at this moment?
A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to have a fantastic job, and now has been shown that it works on mobile phone network as well, what the project is, now is we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: And we went through and nine. Well, it's a <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City <unk>
We are <unk> creatures.
We were terrified in the dark, in rooms with no windows and we avoid the sunlight.
We do the physical models even more <unk> the perfect skin that is still more perfect -- we can make the impossible possible and focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where Iran was there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village sitting in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded it took over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers in the ground.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We got this rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools, we took the slime off, and we left the hard house to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of dead fish and dead fish <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the villages, to <unk>
It wasn't until I then realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While he was running from the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of the village <unk>
It helped clean up the <unk> huge <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that this day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I passed through myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, a few of them still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started looking at the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I should get to get to get to a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the passage of time, they came to be lucky enough photos and it got more <unk> so it went back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week, we use our scanner in the libraries of the temporal agencies that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time you go in <unk> is a different story, depended on course of the photos.
It could be an hour. I could have a couple of weeks.
It could be a couple of months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using how the color of color and detail the water had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered from bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil, all along with the time passed, I continue to <unk> by that <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't play the picture unless it clean up, dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a remarkable <unk>
It's very easy to damage the pictures of the photos already anymore.
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to be in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> herself but just stopped when he tells you that <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would not have been able to be able to put up the images in a single picture, and we took the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble of a lot of far away from where he used to be his home, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His children small, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave him their photos his younger son to go 14 years ago.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could ever have, and something that he could look at, but something that I could remember from the past that was not marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there. They had been joined by hundreds of them -- they helped us clean up more than <unk> by <unk> photographs -- the great majority came into their own <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of photos and totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody wanted to.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take on but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This was the project to restore little bits of humanity, of bringing someone out to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something else with something bigger to give up something, using their talent to something that are not identical models.
To end up to read this electronic email. I sent him Cindy that day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my daughter just <unk> off our wall.
In the whole world, all the very few basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> we were curious to wonder about this picture of a bullet running through an apple in an exhibition in just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and you put it into a second <unk> or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of photons just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a <unk>
If we took that bullet and this <unk> <unk> and <unk> in this bottle, how do they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in <unk> <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started looking at these <unk>
Many of photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights in the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it slow to about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that movie?
One day? One day?
It would be a very boring film --  -- a bullet in motion.
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that go from the table, the tomato table, and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
This is the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see an <unk>
But if you look once more and more -- you realize that, as the light is <unk> in the tomato <unk> it's still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is bouncing into its interior and goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at the bottom, then it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so we just get to some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with very <unk> <unk> we took those data data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those raw data in the raw data and <unk> it.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get to enter the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
So when you project a laser project you can record a <unk> photograph that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
We can see it happen.
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that would be <unk> collisions with what's going on around the curve, and it's going to be around the curve, which is going to be around the curve, and it's going to be able to create cars.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light by using the open windows on the open windows of the open window.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body -- <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of thinking about the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> he became the science in art, an art of photographs of photographs.
I realized that all of the data data that we collect each time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see ourselves.
They create a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are left from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events occur in the world is sometimes going to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's just time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and then it became famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are <unk> who would be looking for a change, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who has a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of all today having a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This organization says that every European telephone company, every single nonprofit Internet provider has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls whom. Who sends an email to whom.
Who sent a text to whom.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and up to two years, in their telephone company or their Internet provider or the Internet.
And all Europe was planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police in East Africa.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask myself, and I didn't get a certain <unk> It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
By the end of the end, it was <unk>
You get the demand and they will send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD in it.
And the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step back at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data <unk>
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open came back City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and start to go back and forward.
You can see every step I give up.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicates with each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
And you can see all this.
You can see the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who is an email to whom, to who, this is all possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the <unk>
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The Berlin Wall was probably never happened.
And as a result, neither is the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of track our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come back home, tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and that it's not that fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to give you to remember you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I <unk> my mom six times in a different direction, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> that's why they were <unk> all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The so-called C. Isn't it genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mom and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, although they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that I happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them to present them.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
And Christmas center, they are at the shopping center, drive in circles in search and what do you see?
16 empty empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There will be a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian woman, and woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same run.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe when I don't know if you're not puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> it -- <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters older sisters I <unk>
If my three sisters older sisters went to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I did it.
The <unk> I carry on was very hard and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a professor, which has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and still being the family of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think that will be appropriate to <unk> the <unk> as it campaign.
People who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating three months without eating three months and so <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend on the summer summer on the coast of innovation, I wasn't coming.
And I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we lie in <unk>
On the summer summer often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk -- I got me made out of <unk> <unk> on the back, and I was struck by the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can hold it into the head.
My parents will come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I would go in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
All of us are <unk>
I did all the <unk> tasks I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> I finally got a <unk>
I have learned <unk>
The end of the end <unk> finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I was finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they thought they could not make the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for that that literally had been born and gave him an actress without cerebral <unk>
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors.
Al <unk> came home, and my first tour, <unk> was as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> directors aren't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just give them perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour of New York City <unk> famous from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell in the very high speed of New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little horrible rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at time remind us to work out and <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cable that has been behind Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate school, and I went back to a study and sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed the desk of the guy who was not coming out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> and ran my chair.
Something fun that I learned at direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never <unk> from me no longer than any more.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would use clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terror <unk>
What disease does you have?
We should really be praying for her."
An <unk> suggested I would even add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make somebody on the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that's less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We are still going to use our entire society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to a very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet on the <unk> <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give the young refugee kids a tiniest part of what my parents would be saved.
It was the only time my father watched me live, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town in the South Side of <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The <unk> <unk> to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, no longer <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
One day you get about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He speaks to a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get a new money to buy new clothes to send home.
They show a young guy.
They finally went home.
It's starting a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That little boy of that little village with the great city of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with the al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> the <unk> urban <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking at something beyond <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't afford to opportunities, the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit hospital Hospital.
I remember going to be at that hospital <unk> in <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to hold up to some juvenile leaders on a business stage.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sit and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate graduate college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war had destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a company.
He started <unk> motorcycle to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> and I think the spirit of business can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so fast.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until a little bit, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to choose by creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now is working in the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
And by the way, he's not growing a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO working for the government, but their story, their innovation really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need to make their ideas for reality.
They need expertise and guidance in the development and put it out of their businesses.
<unk> to young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to creation, and they will create a real estate for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park Park Park is how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain the <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to get out of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves as a <unk> and not being on the path that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful lake that's when I discovered something awful.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the heart of apple -- <unk> balls of paper <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had had to <unk> who they thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, for 11 tons of waste waste and two thousand tons of products -- every single day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their trajectories and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a lot more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I have the <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days in which it's very strong you would be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of bringing it over their body tons of trash every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> waste collection is one of the most dangerous section of the country, and I learned why.
You're going out and you're going out in traffic all the day and you go down all around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And the trash is also full of dangers that often fall out of the truck, and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
You always have to be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor of the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective holders of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective form every day, this begins to recover from its container and its dangers are inherent in the real ways.
We had been controlled by decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy are starting to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just giving up your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average speed day we need.
I mean just the speed when you get used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about it, or <unk> or carry on with us our coffee cup -- our bag of coffee, our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that it takes about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe helps you reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper recycled as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day, but I began to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that I started looking at waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about it -- represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic ...
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next thing you see somebody whose work is to clean up the trash of you, take a moment to get it.
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to think of our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, it doesn't have anything to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure of free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little monkey <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the inputs on the building.
And this extends out with an <unk> atrium, that creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, and the rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that will lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that let them move the air and light in a controlled way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of the online there were more local.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic, not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to make the energy power for the building in a city where electricity is short at almost every single day.
So we got a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are gathering water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the bigger that I have designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its surroundings, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve gates of access to connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets and creating 12 beta blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the doors and straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so much natural nature.
So we would have a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of almost as a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that have a higher density on higher levels and lower density in the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as to give the community that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them up and make such a activities like a two miles a morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super hard for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I was <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took my teacher from my master grades.
And then I did.
I would look at the grades of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the stuff.  And I had to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other guys had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows from <unk> and I just got a row out of it, just to be there, because I was there.
I still wonder what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get to me.
It's that it all was obvious <unk>
I will never be surprised.
But most of all, I was afraid of the reason that I forgot that this little girl, so small was so good to <unk>
I add jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
But also the primates. The <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I have never seen a study that will run the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
I would have no Shakespeare.
I had the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> it almost has all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work -- "In pursuit of the <unk> time, the <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also about the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to fall to sleep.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how fast it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in the storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> to paste the knife, right?
<unk> do us all novelists and that is something that I understood understood.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that would be detected in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> they like the large quantities of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> they suddenly hear behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- the <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the old English interpretation or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking at knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> These were the <unk> into the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us experience, it causes us to have a much deeper range of feelings that a much more profound and vital range than a wise man that can be <unk>
We are saying we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are revealed to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us behave in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife would do it.
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, that he didn't get away in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspected without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was turning into the <unk> of her wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels really described how they <unk> us to look at intensity but not precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more <unk> we become aware of the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to make violent acts of violent acts or illegal.
<unk> lead us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about my case at eight years, and I was sorry, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan of 52 year-old age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since I was sent messages to be used messages to himself -- for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I was very close to awe.
Because let's be realistic.
What's huge -- even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to reach from your self and <unk> from what you ever saw, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, takes your rings, empty your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the path of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street, and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal voice.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, I sound so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the six -- once <unk> <unk> in all with its solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times we see <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like to treat the <unk> like a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the greatness in the greatness of the excellence of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in the greatness of the greatness in
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> them at the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the International <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> piece of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence on the gray surface is the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the greatest selling in the U.S. history.
To reach the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a number of 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities, universities, government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, from which he separated after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that they were because the Kennedy Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> gave us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask him, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly about the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was the wonder to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the Moon in a context of a long list of technological 25.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox was invented.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a <unk> but in 1969, the crew crew <unk> flew 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism admit about the power of technology has evaporated in to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars -- to create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seems to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I don't take the <unk> tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that was really going to happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard that over the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had distracted us and had enriched it with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't predict the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that they have been created by less ambitious companies than <unk> and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused us to be <unk> creation of ideas by funding by funding or even false problems.
But I don't think this is good enough.
It's mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were on their high point without caring for risk, they preferred small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and which is in the long run, but in the long run, they have not been invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a straight commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can compete in the price.
Now, technologists, business and economists are according to what politics and international treaties <unk> development of <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, it turns out.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can make things better, or the yields for the storage and food <unk> but there will be massive enough while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes we have a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The President Nixon would read the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it should be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition <unk> like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the difficult and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction just like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, and it's a very widespread belief.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should get back trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a job that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think the confidence has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own grade, I don't know the answer.
It makes me think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could be augmented in others.
I don't have it.
But I can tap into opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still remain pretty <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen, on the street is almost exactly halfway through the road.
But this is the evidence that enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is <unk> attitudes that people belong when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody can tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to <unk> trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a particular type of official <unk> or a type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I mean, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary elementary teacher that I know to give the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop them all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence level, because they try to <unk> the good inherent trial to actually trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what is <unk> trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say that, you say, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
And what it is about is making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're compelled to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the commodities -- and it's responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent, and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is so, I still haven't got any <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are going to think of what we trust.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems from accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional institutions, officials and so forth, that made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, <unk> the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> that I will see the <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability which is meant to ensure the <unk> and evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do a difficult task, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know about similar examples.
It was all about that, for the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if it will be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and if we get to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
You go to the task to rebuild trust, put things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough technologies to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it all the way, all the time.
But you also have to bring up evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes every day, everywhere, makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks on says I can afford it without giving explanations for.
I take them back and return to me for money, or you turn them into the color of the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
Since the early computers we have been able to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly more and more and more, which is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I began to imagine how to <unk>
It first created this tool that gets into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the booms.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the skill <unk>
In the division of Science <unk> from Microsoft, together with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital digital area.
We put a transparent bombsight with the cameras in depth to detect your fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels straight with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can look through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there's below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are typing in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
We had a lot of us who would have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system does the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And in digitally programming the object, we release it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality sometimes we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities of physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us having to get rid of our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you <unk> that boundary, the only limit that you have is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
And then of surviving the Islamic Revolution, they firmly believe that there was just a <unk> path towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and what the first books I would do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it is not propaganda for <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt and to start the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
So let's take a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never happened to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it also in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the Christ, <unk> are social, policies and spiritual.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized <unk> Chinese is literally <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I was <unk>
Having a broken dream -- it's really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its more important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a graduate student in psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> came up on my office sofa, and he took shoes off and told me that he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My guest roommate had a <unk> like first a client.
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the African stories that Alex brought up to the sessions, was made easy to move your head while I was looking at the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start working on, and you go home after, you have children later, even death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to get over.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex talking about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like me to marry him."
And then my squad squad he said, "No, no, but maybe you <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head head after what was <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in his development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of recklessness benign women was a real problem and had real consequences not just for Alex and his love life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes in the age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! That's amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that make their life have happened to your life will have happened for when they have 30 and <unk>
People in 40, I don't agree to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up in the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from themselves, now it's the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during its <unk> than in any other moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to the top of 28 and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the time to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life has a <unk> impact on the person that is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an <unk>
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every single day, <unk> intelligent, kind of interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes at the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned out the music and everyone began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit extreme -- but it doesn't look at the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, to pick a city, to have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You notice that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very hard, their previous life had been even more difficult.
And we were often going to get in our sessions, but then you raise her as the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and <unk> for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new <unk> <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then I was looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In case of <unk> please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I got <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> male or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to get rid of that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: identity of identity generates a lot of identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to do.
I'm not <unk> exploring exploration, I'm looking at exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore the work and he made them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds are limited to who you know what you know, what you know about, what do you talk about, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of its closest circle.
Things new things come from what they call weak ties friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we put it into this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then, to meet the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as she was <unk> she would soon give her family to when she has a couple and form her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choose the person who you live right now, or you're going to wake you now, when you all on Facebook begin to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or kill time with whoever you will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I sent myself a letter that said, "Now the emergency room spaces are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that go out of Los Angeles, and they go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes a difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the ages of 25, even a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even next generation.
Here is my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> <unk> like Emma every day: The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, you get your identity, use your weak bonds, you choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very philosophical job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teaching them mathematics to seventh <unk> in New York City public schools.
And as any professor, I test tests and tests.
I did tasks.
When the work was coming, I was <unk>
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure more than better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios.
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what to be able to predict about the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in slums.
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
and who is going to make more money?
In all of those different contexts that came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it was not I.Q.
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to reach goals very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is embracing their future, day after day, not just a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my resolve questionnaires and then waited for more than a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greatest chance of graduation, even when we were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in the West Point or the National <unk> in which the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about the science of development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you learn the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job ethic.
How do I keep this for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What do I know is that the talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, evil is commonly related or it is even related to the long-term disability.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that there's a permanent condition.
So the mindset mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, and we have to start to fail, to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my more <unk> <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An academic academic is going 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic science.
The first 200 of them will allow us to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I started with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you could even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> I am shouting at me, this symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old West.
I call radical about eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big thing.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the ground.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it gets too hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out above the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> there is someone at home?
This person is going out hidden from one door, which is <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, keep <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical is going to allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun with the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> will promote their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The film has mastered its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic bullet.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial <unk> of child <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a little metal boy and a boy who was <unk> <unk> to a girl in their own <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive -- like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling <unk>
Do you use magical shoes to defeat the <unk> they were born by the <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing in the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> people and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the oversight level had been <unk>  So she was in the room and was just impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
It would be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
So I would have a sense that Luke get a military to <unk> for government?
<unk> this with the Oz of Oz
How do Dorothy your movie?
And we do it with <unk> and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, right?
Why is there so much <unk> capital force in the movies for our kids, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know that the Princess <unk> does not give the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected that the ear of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get your reward, and you don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a suit suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and I defend the Disney princess for any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, guys, they are not really their target audience.
They do a fantastic job by teaching girls how they defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how they defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely ones like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movie movies.
Of course, the most successful topic of every time is continuing to come up with classic after <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are hiring a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is a movie of a <unk>
Is it very good. Don't let the <unk>
Well, almost any of these films is going on the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not getting roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the evaluation of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do -- in the movie, there's more than a female character who has <unk>
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else of the boy that you like it?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things together.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a idea of consensus that is a quality Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Get the bed up to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go into numbers.
In 2011, the most popular movies -- how many of them believe that they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it would do.
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the blame of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are tightly <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools for our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> whether at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily by parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is changing radically.
You should read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress in it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and get more stories where their work was to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I loved was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand covered and it's hard to look at it.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me get <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, my little beach in Maine had grown up to almost 1,300 miles away from the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern lake of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain view, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at are the real chemical changes in the landscape of building and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find a former old city called <unk> per thousand years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Roman about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great revival of the ancient art -- architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, she moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try and find the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball baseball <unk>
So we use NASA NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the sample of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of a number hundreds of years that date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a workshop in <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but we would go back to place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire.
Now sharing knowledge is the most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that in the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 11.
Do ideas actually began in 1984 <unk> B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found out from high time.
It certainly puts out of sea <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that you have done.
Now we have a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are competing in a bike <unk> and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on its side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- <unk> the threshold of the door.
In the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It's a brown horse.
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> by shooting on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go into the mouth.
You walk down on the side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making it maximum of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his <unk> singing <unk> I <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven come towards you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping into you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that is taking every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> hoping that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> <unk> just once.
It will be the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I will use entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, this is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and she has one of the better memories of <unk>
And I asked him, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory of it.
Everybody who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we have trained us to do these miracle acts of memory using some old old techniques, <unk> years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English man, but a little bit <unk> he said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live, on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year that I don't just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to figure out how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem with <unk> it's amazing.
It was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum. I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> -- he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the film <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library from Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And in return, I read a number of treaties on the drawing of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> memory and <unk> wasn't such as rare as you can find it today.
A long ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
We've changed to us, and I would say that they have also changed our cognitive fields.
We already don't have any need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where we still are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is a <unk> in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a women's champions into the lab.
They wanted to know, it will be brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference in a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with that <unk>
When they put them on an MRI MRI MRI MRI machine, their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that in the memory champions get rid of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is managing as a armed race where every year, someone has a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of competitors should get to a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory professor.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> from John <unk> <unk> that he's about to try and memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> binary <unk>
In a half hour. Yeah.
And as there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> they're unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told her work is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.

But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They wear white hats.
They have <unk>
It will be good when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting together <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who sat at a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> a poet.
He stood up to him, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as the <unk> room was <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them all all of us, but it would look like the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So you could not get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closed eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in between the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or telephone numbers, and word numbers for the word numbers of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space <unk>
If I tell you that I was telling you that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> you are very likely to do it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> in their lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the prototype of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember and the crazy things that you want to remember the more crazy and crazy -- and it's the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make that memory of the same way that I would have done it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you are in the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, <unk> and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote <unk> that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that weird journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not word for word, that will be confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the word <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The <unk> phrase would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensively on this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
Seriously, is it like seeing a lot of people sitting up taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all of them -- before sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> of a <unk> school <unk>
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected I was going to.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about doing is getting more and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was fairly pleased with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some security eyewear covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could <unk> in some kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I got the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to get <unk> and phone phone numbers, and this is actually not the point.
These are just so <unk>
Because it's based on fairly basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building memory <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of ideas about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a donated <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus profoundly deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even true.
They work because they make us <unk>
It will make a kind of deep processing kind of kind of care that most of them is not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things make <unk>
And if there's something I want to leave you with today, it's what I would like to do with today, I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human in front of us, who walk around our side -- we will be so <unk> we will be so <unk> that we don't even want to be in <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just take a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everyone was watching television and so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me and every time I went back to me, and I went back to <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or of those areas, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you can think about in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it so that we think about it in a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these are <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> it has this round round -- columns, brick brick -- that let me get <unk> what they <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that constantly drives new technologies, new new solutions for today's life.
And we will try and push them and push them so far away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to those symbols that are <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we make the pendulum back forward, over and over and over again, we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Something really hard.
So we go into the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
You know, <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We took those ways that we know and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took closets we took them back and <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial malls and we moved into the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the <unk>
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They are easy. They are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we need to adapt to memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s, and in the early 1990s, we started to experiment with called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have to have new design techniques on the computer, and we found ourselves with new ways -- a few ways that they were <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, a building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academics and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism in Bilbao increased in a half thousand percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, <unk> Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star <unk>
But how is it possible that these ways, wild and <unk> how is it possible that they will become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes that meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium country with other star architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these very few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and ultimately, we all are photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't just take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before I know if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing every time faster, so it comes to being on both extremes in <unk> and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols in almost <unk> with emotional charge, of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings were exactly the way the product was finished, not just surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building had been built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and you're no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
You can listen, and you don't leave it through the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find innovative solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historic brick of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sport or <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream about swimming in the New York City, in New York, and raising half a million dollars in the community united around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what it matters is what we built.
Students already know how to make more ecological buildings, smarter and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give up the way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and already started walking.
And it makes it great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is you look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those kisses <unk>
It's beautiful.
<unk> all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I would say, "How do you want to do this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager he just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week at school.
It's got a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite the fact that his mom is telling him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells her it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells you, and what his friends, or school classmates say, don't know who they believe.
So a video of her, she publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal and legal <unk> who gets these answers at one of the stages of their most vulnerable emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that they go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the comments that they do.
There is no divide between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk> <unk>
What is the greatest thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a matter of every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover of the news <unk>
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what they compare young people.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we're sure we want our kids to grow healthy and be individual.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you're looking good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you can get a lower note at the average of your fellow people who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it comes regardless of what these young girls are in the same way.
So to be quite clear, we're talking about how you see not how you are.
The lower self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers in a time shattered at least less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, engage in more diets not healthy diet than you can take you to a <unk> food.
They have low self-esteem.
They're easier for people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all because of all these things that make more powerful decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet -- health and aesthetic, and sexual relations at ages, without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health care system, and our government costs it billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they have no higher rates.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think of a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, I don't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we need to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many available programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children continue to do not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six keys. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of these are <unk> points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem than work.
An education is a fundamental thing, but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
To challenge the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
And all of us can begin to do that taking responsibility for the kind of images and feedback that we publish in our social networks.
We can get them to people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and like companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to be valuing their own being valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who do you have in mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
To his <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is to two car seats -- what would it mean for her if she was released from that voice <unk> in her interior, he would kill him not to have long legs -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and we would give their potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> all of us.
But let's take our kids the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and by how they make us feel.
They bring the self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, will become agents of safe change agents in the same morning.
Let's do it.
On October five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Cuban League <unk>
By <unk> initially he was naive, but being imprisoned by the other charges in the company of others, started planning on attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were being held by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, you couldn't get it.
Later on, it would be convicted of her participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a engineer <unk> with a <unk> American mother, both elementary school, both of the two made the way to give me a happy childhood to give me.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most of the Muslims, come to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't require a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion -- in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he was arrest he sat with me and explained to me that over the last week, he and some friends had been going to sleep <unk> in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot him up to the little orange light on the target and, for surprise of all, especially me, all the goal on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
<unk> such a son.
And all of us, the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put together with 700 pounds of explosives at the underground park in the north tower in the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability in my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody already that was time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me, the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white person, but it will be the new class of class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> to grow <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was raised as long as I judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or religion.
So how could I open up the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, because I had been victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, towards the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids had made friendship, was Jewish was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go out to the light that detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and I felt very proud to be able to beat the barrier that the entire life had been done to me that the whole life had been made of.
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that many of them were the most nice and less critical ones that had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> I developed a sense of empathy towards suffering from others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people <unk> exactly how I would have to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of being homosexual but I know what it is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart made me become honest with my <unk> and I was helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure out in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not alone.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who had been suffering with endless with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and to start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the biases.
I do this by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
Because of the victims of terrorism to talk about those <unk> acts as <unk> to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I'm shown here as proof that violence is not inherently true to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there is a film that is project in their minds.
It's an amazing film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as the moments of your childhood that project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie itself, tea, you and you.
There is nothing to get them more directly.
At least, I know that I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certain that you are aware of.
Life is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware, anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we have to get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science in nature, is objective of nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective life.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, it will make that vision.
psychology studied the behavior, the neuroscience studied the brain -- but no one mentioned awareness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
It was about 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment that science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was cool.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of thing in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy Nancy a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that that this kind of business is responding to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are making certain areas of the brain and what they are going to do?
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't match the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does it exist?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they work <unk> how they adapt and <unk> and <unk> are all questions about how we target it.
And that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions in the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we talk to them, how we talk to them, how we talk <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here is the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we get at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this; the physics is explaining chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All of the idea of subjective subjective movie, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is where you study everything you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is fairly close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
And physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It will be fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, they look at principles, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century <unk> he discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws of Newton. So he <unk> laws of Newton. And he <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- time, time, long, mass, then per question of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it doesn't be the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is we need to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the time -- the natural processes.
And physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can put in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what they're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only the humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when they think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some kind of an element of raw feeling, you find some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anyone think something so crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is really critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that will address the thought with the physical process, is to be <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there is information processing there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human being, very complex consciousness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematicians.
It has an mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the extent of information that is built in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration a high degree of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration that is very meaningful, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality behind the reality below.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the physics equations you can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have quite serious social and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then it had to be a vegetarian, then it must be.
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think about it, this tends to transform your vision, whereas what matters in terms and the moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problem with quite serious ethical problems about the development of development systems of smart computers and the ethical ethic.
Finally, you can ask for consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group -- as the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective collective consciousness -- a internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something to be a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village Victoria.
I had a very normal profile. It's an area in education.
I went to school, I stayed with my friends, <unk> me with my sisters lower.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to be <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a bad problem.
She actually hasn't achieved anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a lower profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the middle 11 minutes at the middle 11 minutes in the middle 11 studies I got up and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about stuff in the school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with individuals like <unk>
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, individuals with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I am on this stage -- I know what I do in this wheelchair -- and you're probably waiting for you to go, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid, <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were here in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make it remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or this is a <unk> "Before <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a bunch of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability for people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad news that is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that I've been talking to me with strange <unk> to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work was a public profile.
It was like I was getting stuck in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are going to lead to people with disability with people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person, is actually a tough thing.
So we were looking at some things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> which is deliberately because I was called the social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those photos too.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They're just using their bodies to take the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to focus on the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells us as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of a lie, because you have sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here to shine the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by any anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people who are disabled at all.
However, not <unk> that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a few <unk> <unk> to collect the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery battery in the battery of the chair.
That's great.
We learn from the strength and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a stretch of stairs has never done a <unk>
Never.   So <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we would be <unk> by wake up from bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 grade at a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you think you know about about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think really <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality is <unk>
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and it's going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because <unk> reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running from the game of play to 100 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pounds of <unk> and we were trying to do it with all their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos in order to show you what the Google <unk> is under the helmet, I'll give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video here.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, University of Washington.
<unk> from <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of an <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go into <unk> how we take it to the next level?
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, OK.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What would be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before and make a <unk> which will be a fan experience.
When I can be touched by <unk> by putting the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
Which will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> his diapers <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get <unk> <unk>
They <unk> reality by <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> in 1965, they put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL, they put radii in the <unk> and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see their next thing to be shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that wear them in, you don't have to worry about having a <unk>
They were to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches who want it because they don't follow their instructions. They lose them, they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
evil is going to have information <unk>
This brings the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for you.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine the field <unk>
We would take the ball and <unk>
I would take an open receiver all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the <unk> system <unk>
It will be <unk>
Another <unk> <unk> you know, there's an open product.
Take the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees its bombsight a area of grass that lights up, and it can modify the career.
It <unk> <unk> the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something to create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I'm wondering is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to just use it as a bread and test like our entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use <unk> reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It makes billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how ecologically are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is <unk>
How much is for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> reality is close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years in the country would go back to the south end of Bertie County, which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to be in the <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open to <unk>
Joseph <unk> a head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as it is that each of you from it, from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones -- some of which are vital organs.
Most people die in an impact.
The people who don't normally lie in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who <unk> this method of suicide will give you the death of the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in their most dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man was talking to an official in his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of Julius last year when he got a call from a possible suicide bomber sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be able to <unk> and she opened the box.
It was <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of kind of clever and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the mother of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had had the order.
damage damage suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family or a friend or somebody loved it to be suicide out suicide out.
What do you do?
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but we need to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't know <unk> or say to the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
You can just be there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid to <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them is to tell you about the same as circumstances have thought of finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to do to <unk> social isolation.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote me this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with her permission and blessing that they were <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I guess, you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I noticed more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the game of 49 with her father on the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as it disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real infectious disease.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way her son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March March 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I got my bike.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next hour and a half a year, I heard like Kevin talked about their depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her account that day to go back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was the thing that made <unk> and gave me the hope and the other life of life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
They stopped talking about and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother <unk> and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events from 11 of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
I mean, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I was describing Kevin when I was just six months, completely unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give it because of God for you.
I really got in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writing, <unk> when I visited the General Hospital in San Francisco at night, you would take off as the patient.
I know I did have it <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> <unk> father.
It was openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not only something I have found myself in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was killed with poison.
That act, in spite of the end of his own pain, I teach me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own chest pain.
All of the general thing, this is just one of three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Out of those incidents I've been directly involved in, I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
For that time, I got his hand in three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few of you who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one of those people have said that the top of the back, they realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> in San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must work to do.
suicide can be saved.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not there, but in your inner eye you know what you are, and a question asks you how to become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way.
When I became a model I felt that I had ever achieved the dream that had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my myself.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go to me later, when I look at this picture -- I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the <unk> <unk> which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called epiphany.
This is mine.
He recorded me as a <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this t-shirt on his head.
And my mom said, "Why is he always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair is a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be what I'm bad, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mother, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as though something else -- this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still had a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
And that night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was taken over the cost of <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> and I won <unk> and I was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was within the world of <unk> <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was from queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the very remote <unk> of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my home card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, do I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you go to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put my name on my name.
She also sat on me when I stayed in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities are doing the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license, and the name of gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
And suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could be able to conquer my dream and moved to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> she was living in his truth, but he <unk> he finally arrived.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November, we make a global vigil for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood in the face of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to living my true truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer has no more <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk>
My parents' network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've lived to young women who have been <unk> who had <unk> and sometimes when they were called and told me that their parents could not embrace it, I took my mom and she said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Some times worked, others don't. It's just the gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to a gender at the birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that sometimes that task didn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The gay movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. Thank you.
In many <unk> societies, and tribal societies, they usually know for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when he was hunted their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National Civic Prize, was made very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women, is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in medieval societies right from the beginning, when I was born a child, his birth would not get away.
It's not welcome, nor for your father, and my mother.
<unk> next neighborhood gives his <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When she gives birth to second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school will be in my brothers.
At age 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go in adolescence when it was at 13 years old, you have to tell you to go out of your house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that honor, they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this election code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affects the American members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a major rule of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very good <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and they embrace their father and their mother and their decisions from the elderly, even if they don't want.
If I <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or <unk> with an old man, you have to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I was fascinated by a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she got four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?"
Yes, I have <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of the child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
An <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspiration where it can explore their potential life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was looking at the form of Copenhagen Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
And the encouraged to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've been taking care of all these good values in my school and girls on the same.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
They taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters -- more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
They were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and lifted up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog was offered to my New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between my life and death, she whispered to my wife to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please don't <unk>
Let's get the fair cause.
It <unk> your life in play because of the truth, because of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches and you had severe headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that goes through the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never get away.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to do well. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't just run his task.
You fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring that has made so audacious to <unk> and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group -- where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work I'm going to talk today about here is the science of the brain, I did before joining Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to an operation of your brain.
Are you still like intelligent or not?
Don't be like this, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
After the operation, I had to decide what to make, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of <unk> and <unk> and trying to <unk> to continue with life.
Instead, I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get the dose to try and get the dose <unk> because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying to mix different <unk> and I was amazed by how small changes in the dose would dramatically change my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my way to think, my behavior with others.
And a particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I set up doses and standard chemicals for a man from Berkeley -- and I was amazed by watching my thinking.
It was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some versions of them are <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that it wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that was on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So you couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they need to do, since then I take better with men.
What I was trying to do is make that to <unk> those hormones and those neurotransmitters and so forth, was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my creative thinking of ideas.
And we think about almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of the key point -- how do you get those mental imaging that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to mental thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> you really would be extremely sophisticated and good <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images right now, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of his mind?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments made by two major groups in neuroscience.
And they both used international technology, image imaging imaging to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
So the column of the medium shows you the scanning of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left-hand column on the left.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed up to the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they took their brains to create a huge array of reactions in the brain in front of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new new animals, and while it was so much <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using this scanning brain information -- to show you what it looked like that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems, of available resolution systems today, and their resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes to you.
I can't offer that one.
A lot of these are proposing new projection techniques of images, even I have to do with the recent MRI result -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, <unk> <unk> only offer little improvements at the resolution -- not a lot of the resolution on the resolution -- not a thousand as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different drinks, like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever advances in <unk> and bright solutions.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, they added the magnetic magnetic patterns to the frequencies of radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing. We can increase in mass <unk> information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands of we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid -- but the hormones of the hormones and the <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity.
We will be able to <unk> our ideas based on the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the experience of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few options more than opening up this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be saying to some person for the first time that loves him or tell someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to focus on life.
So I think it's a tough conversation, and even though our issues can be able to vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have gone out of that closet that's universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I'll be <unk> that by the <unk> of my pants and I got my head my head a little bit, I would ask myself a little kid, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear as uncomfortable at the table.
I had my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The dad <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother would blow a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> out of it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
It should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was just about to come into the female issues at the table at the table --  I had the date of Betty <unk>
The quotes from Gloria <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
And then I breathe deep down and I went down and my backs and my backs was four years old with a pink, and I looked at what is not a challenge for a feminist, a feminist, a girl with a question: "Are you kid or <unk>
So I breathe deep down again, and I got <unk> near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me and paying attention, and he said, "My favorite friend is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all about it. They just "Ah, ah, you are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some thoughts in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how to live in a closet.
This is how my self is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why I could go out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of your head, but this is the obstacle. It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared in <unk> it's more difficult than she was <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is more difficult than telling your child from five years you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only a tough thing.
We need to stop looking at what is difficult to do with what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our closets and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant <unk> <unk> to fight any four years to go into coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my hometown of <unk> <unk> my gay, and the moving is just the most scary thing ever ever done.
My family, my whole strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable verse was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people invited out, they knew that I was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and I finally got to one where my parents were in my parents, people who knew me so much.
And after talking a moment, one of the women -- <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite <unk> show.
Our favorite show Will Will and Grace show.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I'm hoping to show you desperately support, and to get me to know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must be aware that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct simply <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex people.
You communicate their truth.
It will never be done by that.
And some of them can be injured injured -- so they have done, but they never am sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark closet -- a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very much themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen as a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical <unk> of computer <unk> as Alan intelligence.
And so, a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's step back a walk.
Let's first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a <unk> race that you know nothing about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien race that doesn't have any of this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence -- they would have forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even a certain time in time, the asteroids that would take away the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that will be given the diversity of possible future.
And finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have been trying to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex work.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a F, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open choice with a T, with the diversity of potential <unk> future, yes, to an impending time, <unk>
In short, they don't like to get <unk>
Nature is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Let's take the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to have a trend for more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find in it.
Surprisingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence testing, playing games of humans, and even make any money <unk> actions, it all without that would have been to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for robotic robotic robotics and human technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we have successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network very well.
This is the same capability of network <unk> it also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and discovering it successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend at the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a series of useful negotiation -- successfully increasing the assets under their management exponentially.
This ability to management will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the word <unk> -- there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk>
Machines will <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion in reverse.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that intelligence can actually come up with just going to come up with control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I often ask me, "How do you search for targets to go from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence -- is the following: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that we go.
Data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and its mother.
In the together, it helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
At his time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused in global scale have gone rapidly our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet by being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, more than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better, our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a world potentially livable world, shown this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> mission, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now providing not just short airline flights, but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth the air is fresh and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets going to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> Earth.
For a lot that I like exploring exploration, I am deep on this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will actually have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and the Earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and will preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can satisfy our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi have in account that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found trials of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough time to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going to get my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where he had <unk>
So quickly, I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to get out and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I got my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they were not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, very <unk>
I'm a career neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate -- <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in their place, which was going to be a bad thing.
Or at least, if bad things happen to be the probability of a total catastrophe here.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about breaking the window, and, I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as you explain to <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong -- then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent things to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not as evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, they will take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space is.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where it's all the right, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you wonder if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use their nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose the keys for the car, Sydney and <unk>
So in home I would go home a place for keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a dish.
For its <unk> a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and be <unk> with it all your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone, a picture of your credit card cards, <unk> <unk> by email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us in medical decisions, and actually by making it for financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you have to take from the one that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today.
So you say, "Yes, I <unk> the <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you need to think about what kind of statistics <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number of necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which believes it is?
How many people have to take it before they help one person?
300.
This as the research of researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I actually explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, brain disease or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and you know, <unk> of the <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include muscle <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So let's think about how to fix this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be eaten by the drug for the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic does it, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this necessary number to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done by the largest men in the 50 of the 50 percent of the prostate -- the number necessary to try and be <unk>
That's how 49 surgeries for one person who has ever been.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
So Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the philosophical thought of rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I landed at the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the gate of entry into the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I haven't ordered and lots of messages of email that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I will never get a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and eventually they mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms.
So how do I understand the sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
You know, we have that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
And I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm so super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I just have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic house there.
Before this time, I'd worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to ask more of art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience this visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I began to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> a social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could tell me.
I chose to get me away.
There's a massive culture.
And just because I don't use my voice that to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can just support myself and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, I work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> I am able to maintain a temporary way of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could do it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and to complete on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals both of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different <unk> parameters.
If you are mapping a different <unk> to each finger while you play piano as the facial expression, the <unk> movement -- the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get the piano, just a button at a time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a way to express a clear concept, or a sense of <unk>
If just a key key, the <unk> would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and then take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you take it down, and you <unk> the speed of it, you see it as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to me from T-Mobile.
All tonight."
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses the time in <unk> and how the distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is an hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite -- with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, I'll go again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands in high school.
Now we're going to do it both on your head as my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or at the same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a grade, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it over again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
Now look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest. But they transmit meanings very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, we live in a very dramatic world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that we don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure. And I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you how to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "You can tell you everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a picture of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because the adults would lie to us from the awful, truth.
When I became older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning other people.
Time country, I'm now adult and teach in the school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, he <unk> the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastics.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, and collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and put this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use those huge ships.
So along with my students with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
And we collect plastic and reduce it into the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child, and try to get them into something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collect pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids get a lot of fun with robots.
And then we started creating what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up with lunch.
And we're turning light down and the web cameras on stilts, and they put it into a floating robot that's slowly moving through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I was able to go through this invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to get them right away.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet and <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe 70 years ago, cleaning a spill of oil, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest world's largest world's <unk>
They were really surprised because this is the water that you drink is the water that you get out of the water where you get the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown and the oil is also <unk> and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help their sense to help other children.
<unk> a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe I might be able to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half an Japanese half and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power station next to water.
And today, according to the reports on an average of 300 tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that the bulk of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, it looks like, it's safe and blue is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year since the accident and research independently with other scientists, the soil, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, we don't have the <unk> the parents don't know.
But each night we get to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> interfaces to represent real-time data from the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear to the date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear power -- and with the fishermen of fishermen in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking device as we we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so much so much so, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space of social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal, metal wood, chemistry, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where people's dreams can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked, can we invent the future of mobility with energy <unk>
For example.
Now, we can help in mobility of the elderly population transforming their own standard wheels into new self-driving vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible enough, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that actually can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one silk silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes over the environment, the other one had believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that was fighting for free.
The <unk> was only a tool.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we bring all the information to it for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production in mass.
<unk> lines have dictated a world that <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But you don't find <unk> of material <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act mainly like filter the other other mainly as boundary, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that starts gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my worldview.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and it shows you the two screens behind me.
My job at its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You can probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't it do 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe in.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scale scale -- like this robotic arm with a mere scope of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis, that some day not far away from building buildings <unk> and graphics made from genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture of size is only size to model the light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion dating supply to Paris with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second skin that was made from one piece, <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical tool and the instruments that are able to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic wheelchair a chair to the same and structural chair.
Professor <unk> my collaborator came back to the nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern -- becomes <unk>
It will take this surface of 44 different properties, that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to addition to other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home but when I was a young man, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck with me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world that is made of place.
And I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if objects come up with a single <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to bring the kind of material into the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> the most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune on their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical <unk> we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, tough and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- it was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single <unk> material.
When the pieces are <unk> it leaves dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet <unk> billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we were <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition out without the problems of <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more, on the window.
A top-down <unk> tree.
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure from shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the periodic table, we did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, it was <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It makes the light in sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> they don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never stopped.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like to the auditory tract that will help you bring these bacteria and that they will turn their way into their way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, they made more transparent channels to us.
This <unk> digestive system is when it stretches from one end to the next 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very thin.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are a live creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the material <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we would <unk> our skin, we will bring the tissue to hurt and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is using material on layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly intimate architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a tension structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest them in a single material.
In order to figure out how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet, to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the playground of silk.
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different countries, different <unk> and we've discovered that the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
They often broke the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape the grim <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to go into more dark and darker areas that we use a solar path to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat, by putting the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
We were asking for silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> were <unk> and life starts back again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk <unk> they give all this <unk>
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms are <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk> route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produced 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and buildings around us to form a two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature inspired by an inspired nature of us by the first time, which demands us for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can touch it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developed the website. And also, I would play the guitar with a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And I generally like to try and persist in every case, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I <unk> myself for something else, something completely different, and I get stuck in it, and I'm going to leave myself and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk>
Another reason that I had had so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have been thinking back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you would have learned from culture.
You ask yourself, "What do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk> that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again, as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of just before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be not inspires to dreaming of whatever they could be.
In fact, it does just just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you get <unk> you may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned on <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose to.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or true <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that cover their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many other interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
You could help if you divide up in three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> it refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of fit to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in the planet -- data visualization.
<unk> is a company that creates jewels <unk> <unk>
By <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of a unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their background can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is rapid learning.
When we <unk> we <unk> we are <unk>
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and stepping out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to each new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> of independent writer and independent artist.
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin gun mechanics when she was starting their practices and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
You rarely have a loss of time to go to what you would read -- even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, other pages of web pages -- sometimes consultant for Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> 2008 defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world is rapidly changing and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs, the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to them themselves.
We have complex problems, we're going to get them right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> your belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams go up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that will be involved in how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them they are being told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart member, then you spread through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you just realizing being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I tell them, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> of <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our inner <unk> leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps the most important thing, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> to a woman called <unk> they took a <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until she passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain.
The most amazing thing.
If you were to have been alive today, we couldn't give it more help than the <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's recently made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include a lot of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, your likelihood of Alzheimer's disease is almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their years that has Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be loved with Alzheimer's disease.
In America, health care costs 200 billion dollars a year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in the rise of five times in 2050, as we get the generation of <unk> boom.
I may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than from other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the investigation of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the past few years, even scientists, confused with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy person that compared to a patient patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe memory loss and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly the hope of life, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today, we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
You can get the rest of them to make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that it does, and then create a drug that I do it.
Until recently, in the most part, they have been down the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. We're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick each other inside of them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just an initial result -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to figure out that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and pressure on governments, industry, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too much <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not at most cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was looking at this article in the New York Times column from the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The paper about a psychological study is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when we test it myself a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to become 36 and more questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions of example.
Number <unk> if you could wake up tomorrow with one quality.
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
They are <unk> that are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like from him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really struck me the attention, the gadget that two participants had married had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the naked column of a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it is in August, so I guess some of you probably are wondering, keep you together still yet?
And the reason I think you can tell this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before I put the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and I thought that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousands of view.
And that has a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday at night, and this Saturday Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday one had been called the Today Show and "Good <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence by writing about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that <unk> life has been international news -- and that people around the world are actually interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or write what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> that included the experiences of the readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very upset with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders of the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but not just a real <unk> love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for <unk> <unk> between college students, using what he was <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But the study did work.
The participants had felt closer to doing it. Several <unk> studies, also used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used by members of police and community <unk> and they've used it among people of opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I took last summer, which I made personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately they never stopped.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university -- and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you would love you from the person with whom you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to know better after the research <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I'm going to focus on science.
And so I was able to find everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could be a certain shape of the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book that I wrote but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or something.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me most clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably me can demand me.
What I'm looking for is a <unk> it's not just about being <unk> today and being <unk> but I'm going to continue to be happy endlessly through the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a short cut for <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very scary story, because they fall in love feeling beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I say, still together?
And its content with a <unk> or No.
So more than a question, I would submit that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who is deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known man, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still getting together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> Love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I didn't think of everything that a choice.
I didn't think that we had both of them to take that decision, and how many times will it have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always choice or not.
I want you to have been enough to have done and answer 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody as generous, and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I'm going to do, and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually written.
But what I have in change is the chance of choice to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised through a <unk> lesbian in a way, and I kind of got a <unk> of the forest.
The New York City a time ago --  -- something that actually affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and you put it a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later, and we would look at how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
So anyway, he's going to be happy because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like coming from tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it out of all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the photographed of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could be <unk>
Instead, the opposite: was the opposite: in some way it seemed to be size, as if it was that I would get the text with a <unk>
So I did so, I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, and these strange bottles that I was finding on the street, and all I could find out because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow it up, draw the same way around a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can make an idea.
Then I did some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin with drawings of human beings inside of the layers.
It was great, except for one thing.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, and then in a other window and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would come up with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 30,000 pounds.
Two feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the <unk> of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden's -- there's all kinds of weird things you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
So also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of the other.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> which keeps Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand where I <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that matches the <unk>
But anyway, his tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
They've <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of them is an archive of our culture, through media and material and <unk> or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file archive and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is the chest, you can tell the entrance to it.
I will see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of your chest, and you cover the penis or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these work because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We cut out the box and all the people in it strikes each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion doesn't work.
We're all made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that there's a pill effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug <unk>
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs -- these are useful to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the cancer count.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects in its most negative place, because in the time that it takes to get to <unk> current <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it is more important, in the HIV HIV.
These are regions regions like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, our lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood stream of patients that are <unk> with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem with HIV treatment with today's drugs that is a treatment for life being oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can be used for anything <unk> including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser pulses to open or <unk> extremely small holes that open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking yourself, "How is it <unk>
We sent a little bit of powerful laser <unk> on the cellular membrane of HIV living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug to a matter of <unk>
Before you realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro -- or in plates, <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, as the laser used again to keep cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it succeeded, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of HIV.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> military organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
So what these groups do is they do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these terrorist agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation with not violent.
I do the field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and actors.
For example, <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to understand or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies were <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for her violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social game network and a military system.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking
We had a complex machinery of <unk> radio stations of television channels and websites and strategy in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine magazine and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising but by using business companies, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run schools, put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not safe and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn through the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to understand the efforts of these groups to deliver security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> price for the population.
But in fact, they provide social services that means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in the Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill a lot of gaps in the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They get part of a territory, run out of all its function, the <unk> run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids, and the more weak are the states, like in the Middle East today, more <unk> and they fill that gap <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in the tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and make peace.
If we understand better to groups -- we will better understand what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors <unk> military power can win some battles, but not give us peace and stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum in order to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that to accept openly the <unk> label would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but quite bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, the people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these <unk> women -- <unk> with men and hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and individual anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and nasty.
I would love me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and he can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I began to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as it would be free to <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible control and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without any need for controls or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our own <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences in account of the way that we care about what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession:
When you go to work, I hear music rap -- <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> from the Yin <unk> <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually have your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> of the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They get out of the fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy fairy tales that they do.
Some of my offenses are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise his children, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has been ignored or spores. historically the needs of the color women of color, the women, gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for the white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist -- I'm a very bad feminist guy.
It also happens to be this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it's going to be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I was a <unk> I think of that <unk> before you try and put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovative and leaders, they are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> fear of what it means that I fear that <unk> fear that I don't be able to do with a little realistic expectations to be able to do with <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call the <unk> <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the Video: Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show. I can see this star star on the first of the <unk> <unk> the feminism and do to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, current cultural critics started endless debates -- if <unk> was or not exactly feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of a adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need much, we need a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad news was, or a more <unk> feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give it a day, to go to action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier than happy by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change affecting effectively their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It was where they are being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, including the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies are not treating women as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially young white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish it in his project, participate in their project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a lot of women as much as they make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also adapt to being even more and more like us are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision choices.
Because we are not groupers -- <unk> without these efforts without adopt these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in the power of directors and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery to us, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because I think <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I was all <unk> to believe that something could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and leadership -- I also discovered that if it was a little brave -- another woman could go and see me and realize that none of us are nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need more of the courage.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had measles to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then walked across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the measles is that the measles may be fatal for a child with an immune immune system -- is one of the most powerful diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this since over half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> and marked by being an fraud called the British Medical Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism from autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her believed to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising funds like <unk> <unk> they routinely refer to autism as an epidemic as if it could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis, and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language don't completely satisfy the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of their son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than seeing with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the storytelling of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told us a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in its usual place without knowing them.
On the foundation of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I declared to see less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as it was <unk> <unk> of places as distant South Africa.
This is actually no secret, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but we now know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine in every 10 children sent by other doctors to his doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold, <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept in a refrigerator on a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 -- that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> social psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers -- I was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as <unk> <unk> without special education, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Service, of Health that were needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw from the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse of autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the genealogy of <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and sense to their data.
How did no one have been <unk> of these kids before?
But then I came up with a reference to an article published in German in the next year in <unk> the following year of <unk> and that then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation for English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> I speak German, and he was translated to her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running an integrated clinic, with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The <unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability, for life that required <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, including them called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
And <unk> had seen autism as a diverse diverse that unites a remarkable variety of soy and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in archetypal culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the diagnostic criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 80s and the early '90s, the changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one broad <unk> structure.
These changes didn't go into <unk> broken.
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked in a lot of talking to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and parents from all around the world knew what the autism was like <unk>
At the same time, they introduced the first <unk> clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> actually expected that the people with autism and their families finally gave the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful, <unk> history, such as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum -- it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have autistic people come together in the Internet to reject the idea that these are the puzzles to solve by new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is not working, it doesn't mean it's cut.
In <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention of attention to detail.
No doubt autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
Seventy years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands in deck of <unk> the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence forms on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
